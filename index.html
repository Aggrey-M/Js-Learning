                <h2>Software Engineering Process</h2>
                <p>Here is my first blog post. Well this is exactly what I used to do back in college but lost myself in non IT formal jobs that have not paid off quite well. I have started my software and web development process introduced again to me by
                    my friend from college Raquel and advised to get on board as a Microverse student. I registered and went through admission challenges, trials and interview which paid off well to get me familiar again with software & web development
                    and I hope to be a great developer by the end of the program.</p>
                <p>I will keep designing this project as a study reference for javascript, react, but for now I have started with HTML and CSS to get used with the whole coding process</p>

                <h2>My Wife & Son</h2>
                <p>My Wife is a great pillar of my life and she has stood with me through thick and thin times. I have a best friend in my wife and she is confident about my love for her. </p>
                <p>Together we are building a family that we hope our children will be proud of as we intend to create a lasting legacy for not only ourselves but even the next generations to come after us.</p>
